## Project Overview
Purpose of this assignement is to develop a searchable front-end to allow users an easy method to find recorded UFO sightings in North America based on various criterea (date, location, etc)

## Results

## Summary
One key drawback of the webpage as it is currently designed is that there few restrictions on the user input.  Using dropdowns or date slicers would be more effective at showing what users can select from based on data.

Reccomendations for further development include: increasing functionality of searching, including sorting based on columns, slicers and feedback on number of records after filtering is applied would be useful to the user.  Including a keyword search might also be helpfull if they are looking for data from the report comments field.
